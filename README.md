# String-matching

Part 1

The goal is to estimate the house price based on various house features using machine learning algorithms.
R-Square score for Random Forest Regression model is higher i.e. close to 1 when compared to linear regression and decision tree regression models. Hence, Random forest regression model can be recommended as the final prediction model.

Part 2

The goal is to match similar products of Flipkart and Amazon and compare the product's retail price and discount price using ML/DL techniques 
Using fuzz library, based on ratio of similarity between the string a threshold is set. If the ratio meeta the threshold then we say products are matching and their retail price and discount price can be compared.
