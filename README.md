# String-matching

Part 1

The goal is to estimate the house price based on various house features using machine learning algorithms.
Random forest regression model performed better when compared to other models as the error was less.

Part 2

The goal is to match similar products of Flipkart and Amazon and compare the product's retail price and discount price using ML/DL techniques 
Using fuzz library, based on ratio of similarity between the string a threshold is set. If the ratio meeta the threshold then we say products are matching and their retail price and discount price can be compared.
